Set up a model folder and download the 'Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf' model, then place it in the folder. I used the 8B parameter model, but you can choose a model with 8B or a different parameter size based on your system configuration.
Set up "SampleMeeting" Folder whar you can have your metting recordings.
